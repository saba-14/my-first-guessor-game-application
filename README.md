# my-first-guessor-game-application
Its been an amazing day learning java ,its third day in a row as we were learning .
Seems intresting till now ,it was an exciting activity writing the code for the guesser game.
Though it seemed like a piece of cake for the first time writing it in the book.
Surely was a task to deal while trying to execute and debug it.
# my-second-guesser-game-application-for-colors
As a fun activity i just decided to change the numbers to colors .
Well just changing the names didnt help me ,as i kept executing the code i realized there were many lines i had to change with respect to datatypes and names and methods .
Well its matter of efforts and it was finally executed after lots of changes.
I HOPE THIS GIVES YOU CLARITY FOR THE TWO CODE FILES ATTACHED.
