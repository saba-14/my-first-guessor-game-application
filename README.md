Its been an amazing day learning java ,its third day in a row as we were learning .
Seems intresting till now ,it was an exciting activity writing the code for the guesser game.
Though it seemed like a piece of cake for the first time writing it in the book.
Surely was a task to deal while trying to execute and debug it.
